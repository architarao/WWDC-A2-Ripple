## General Information
The project, Ripple, is an artistic challenge that aims to visualise different emotions through visual art due to my personal hobby of drawing. I chose this project to help me gain deeper understanding into emotions and potentially find solace in visualising emotions that I experience. 
## Technologies Used 
This project was creates through Processing, since it is well known for its visual animation.
## Set Up
This project was created on Porcessing (java) and as such when using it processing software must be downloaded on the chosen device in acordance with whether the device is using Windows or IOS. 
## Usage
After accessing the file, users simple run the code, press any code of their choosing and after viewing the animation they can use the home button to go back to the default screen. 
## Features
Features of the project include the default screen with the three buttons, and the visual animation that each button depicts to the user.

## Project Status
This project has been completed. 
## Room for Improvement
Areas that can be improved upon is the visual animation of the ripple itself and the default screen. Features that can be added or amended is creating different visual animations for each button rather than the same design.
